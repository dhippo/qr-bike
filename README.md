# QR BIKE PROJECT

The purpose of our project is to offer a solution to athletes that would allow them to generate a QR code in order to access their health data in case of emergency. 
Thus, they will be able to print the generated QR code and find a way to stick it on their bike, their helmet, their equipment.

If an accident happens, their blood type, diseases and all health information will be accessible in a second. 
The goal is to propose to the user to share the information he wants to share.
